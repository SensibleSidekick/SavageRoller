My first project outside of a curriculum, I am attempting to create a character sheet storage and dice rolling app for the tabletop RPG system called Savage Worlds. 

This is a fan made creation, and per the Fan license please read the following: “This game references the Savage Worlds game system, available from Pinnacle Entertainment Group at www.peginc.com. Savage Worlds and all associated logos and trademarks are copyrights of Pinnacle Entertainment Group. Used with permission. Pinnacle makes no representation or warranty as to the quality, viability, or suitability for purpose of this product.” Game in this instance refers to the app being created in question. 

This is currently a work in progress.
